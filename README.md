# SVG-Logo-Maker
Module 10 Challenge: Object-oriented-programming

## Description 

My motivation for this challenge was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo in a SVG file. This app allows users to choose a shape, color, and provide text for the logo.  

## Installation 

User needs the Inquirer package and Jest package for unit testing.

## Usage

User needs to access the command-line application.  For Jest testing, use the following command: npm i jest (to install jest) then type in command: npm run test (to run testing it will prompt either Pass or Fail).  
For SVG-Logo-Maker, use the following command: node index.js
The command-line application will accept user input and will be prompted for information about their created logo. Once completed, a logo.svg file will be created and logo can be displayed in the browser.
